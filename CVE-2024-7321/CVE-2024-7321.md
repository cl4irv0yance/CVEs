### Requirements

Authentication: None is required to perform attack. 

### Additional Items

Escalation of Privileges/Account Takeover may possible via Cookie Stealing. A working payload is still being developed, but retrieving the cookie for the admin user may be possible via XSS and can be utilized by the low level user to escalate privileges. 

### Problem

Cross-Site Scripting (Stored)

### Root Cause

A Stored Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the User Registration (signup.php) of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project, that affects both the 'register.php' and /admin/user.php application components. Malicious code can be injected within both the 'user' parameter due to improper sanitization, filtering, sanitization and implementation of other XSS prevention mechanisms.

### Impact

Attackers can exploit this to achieve account takeover and obtain a session as the administrative user or other users of the application.

 # Remediation

Input validation on arrival should be as strict as possible. Any input that fails validation requirements should be rejected; not sanitized. All user input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into an application’s response. Any HTML metacharacters (< > “ ‘ and = ) should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (&lt; &gt; etc.) In the case where the application’s intended functionality allows users to author content using restricted subsets of HTML tags and attributes, it would be necessary to parse user-supplied HTML to validate there is no dangerous syntax being used.
